## Description

My CV is an interactive Single Page Application (SPA) developed using React, Redux for global state management, and React Router for navigation between different sections. The application serves as my digital CV and personal website, where users can get to know me through information about my skills, experiences, projects, and contact details.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the project from the GitHub repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/EmmaaDy/Portfolio.git
cd my-cv
npm install
npm start
### Open your browser and go to localhost to view the project.

## Features

### Navigation
Use React Router to navigate between different sections or views, including 'About Me', 'Projects', and 'Contact'.

### Local State Management
Use the useState hook to manage local state in components, such as interactive forms in the contact section.

### Global State Management
Implement Redux for global state management, which is used to store and manage data accessed by multiple components, such as the project list.

### API Interaction
Integrate an external API, like the GitHub API, to automatically display the latest projects on the website.

## Description

My CV is an interactive Single Page Application (SPA) developed using React, Redux for global state management, and React Router for navigation between different sections. The application serves as my digital CV and personal website, where users can get to know me through information about my skills, experiences, projects, and contact details.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the project from the GitHub repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/EmmaaDy/Portfolio.git
cd my-cv
npm install
npm start
### Open your browser and go to localhost to view the project.

## Features

### Navigation
I used React Router for navigation between different sections or views, including 'About Me', 'Projects', and 'Contact'. React Router allows for smooth navigation and improves the user experience.

### Local State Management
I utilized the useState hook for managing local state in components, such as interactive forms in the contact section. This helps in making the application more responsive and user-friendly by enabling dynamic updates to the UI based on user interactions.

### Global State Management
For global state management, I implemented Redux, which is used to store and manage data accessed by multiple components. Redux provides a centralized state management solution, making it easier to maintain and update application data.

### API Interaction
In my project, I use the useEffect hook to handle the data fetching process from my external GitHub API. This allows me to efficiently retrieve and update the necessary data. To automatically display the latest projects on the website. This enhances the user experience by providing up-to-date information and demonstrates real-time data interaction within the application.
